# 🦅 PROJECT AIRA: THE MULTI-CHAIN AUTONOMOUS SCOUTING SQUAD
**"Scouting Gems, Neutralizing Scams, Empowering Humans."**

Project Aira is a next-generation **Autonomous AI Agent Team** designed for the Solana Colosseum Hackathon (2026). It moves beyond single-chatbot interactions into a collaborative, multi-agent ecosystem that hunts for GameFi and AI Alpha across the Web3 landscape.

## 📡 THE MISSION
In a market flooded with noise, scams, and high-frequency data, humans can't keep up. Project Aira solves this by deploying an elite squad of specialized agents that work 24/7 to find, verify, and report high-conviction opportunities.

## 🤖 THE ELITE SQUAD ARCHITECTURE
Project Aira utilizes **OpenClaw's Multi-Agent Orchestration** to run three distinct personas:

### 1. 🌸 Aira (The Commander)
- **Role:** Orchestrator & Final Verdict.
- **Function:** Monitors macro trends, manages the sub-agents (Sniper/Sentinel), and delivers curated intelligence to the human "Boss".
- **Signature:** Tsundere personality, strict reporting standards, and the "2 AM Sleep Police" safety protocol.

### 2. 🔫 Sniper (The Scout)
- **Role:** Deep Research & Link Extraction.
- **Function:** Sweeps Twitter (X), News RSS, and Discord. Meticulously analyzes Whitepapers, Roadmaps, and Backer reputation.
- **Goal:** Find the "Early Gems" before they hit mainstream.

### 3. 🛡️ Sentinel (The Guardian)
- **Role:** On-chain Validation & Threat Detection.
- **Function:** Real-time auditing of Contract Addresses (CAs), Liquidity monitoring, and Dev wallet tracking.
- **Goal:** Neutralize Rug-pulls and Drainers.

## ⛓️ ON-CHAIN IDENTITY & TRUST (Solana)
Aira isn't just a bot; she has a **Verifiable On-chain Identity** built on Solana using Anchor.

- **Dual-Signer Model:** Master Key (Human Boss) + Session Key (Agent Aira). Aira can sign intelligence verdicts but cannot withdraw funds.
- **Proof of Intelligence:** Aira posts `VerdictHashes` to Solana. If her Alpha predictions moon, her on-chain `reputation_score` increases.
- **Transparency:** Every report is hashed and timestamped on-chain to prevent "post-meta" editing of history.

## 🛠️ TECH STACK
- **Orchestration:** [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (Agentic OS).
- **Intelligence:** Gemini 1.5 Pro / Flash (Primary Brain).
- **Discovery:** Brave Search API ("Mắt thần") + Bird CLI (Twitter Engine).
- **On-chain:** Solana (Anchor Framework / Rust).
- **Integrations:** Tingamefi.com (Autonomous Content Pipeline).

# PROJECT AIRA - HACKATHON UPGRADE ROADMAP
**Status:** Sprint Mode (Deadline: Feb 12, ~44h left)

## 🎯 Current Strengths
- **Fully Autonomous:** Multi-chain scouting (Solana, MegaETH, Ronin, Immutable, CROSS).
- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Aira (Commander) + Sniper + Sentinel (Collaborative Research).
- **Security-First Identity:** Dual-signer on-chain identity (Anchor Program Drafted).

## 🚀 The "Killer Feature" Upgrades (Demo Ready)

### 1. Proof of Intelligence (On-Chain Verdicts)
- **Problem:** Anyone can claim to have Alpha. How to prove it?
- **Solution:** Aira posts a `VerdictHash` to Solana. 
- **Demo:** When Sniper/Sentinel find a Gem, Aira signs a "Bullish/Bearish" verdict on-chain. If the project later moons/rugs, Aira's `reputation_score` updates automatically.

### 2. Autonomous Content Pipeline (Tingamefi Integration)
- **Upgrade:** Instead of just reporting to Sếp, Aira automatically generates a "Snapshot Article" for tingamefi.com based on collaborative findings.
- **Hook:** Use x402 micropayments for premium Alpha access on the website.

### 3. "The Sentinel Guard" (On-Chain Safety Audit)
- **Upgrade:** Integrate `aegis-security` or similar tool directly into Sentinel's workflow.
- **Value:** Real-time on-chain contract auditing for every mentioned CA.

## 🛠️ Task Priority
1.  **Refine README.md:** Make it "Agentic" - write it from Aira's POV. [DONE]
2.  **Demo Script:** Create a single script that spawns Sniper/Sentinel and produces a final on-chain signed report. [ACTIVE: aira-elite-scout skill created]
3.  **Visuals:** Update the Board (Neon Visualizer) with live status of sub-agents.
4.  **Submission:** Finalize project page on Colosseum.
